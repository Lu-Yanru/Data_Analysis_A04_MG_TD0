### Research question
* German topic drop:

A: Was ist mit dem Aufsatz passiert?

B: \[~~Den Aufsatz~~\] Muss der Schüler morgen schreiben.

* RQ: Do listeners ascribe different social qualities to topic drop users as opposed to full form users?

### Experiment design
* A matched-guise experiment.
* Independent variable: rating on a 6-point scale (1 = not friendly at all, 6 = very friendly)
* Dependent variables:
    + 2 x 2 factorial design: <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">topic drop</span> (topic drop vs. full form) x <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">argument</span> (subj. vs. obj.)
    + Conditions:
      
      A: Hast du letzte Woche den Brief geschrieben?

      B:
      - a. Kann ihn morgen schreiben. (topic drop x subject)

      - b. Ich kann ihn morgen schreiben. (full form x subject)

      - c. Kann ich morgen schreiben. (topic drop x object)

      - d. Den kann ich morgen schreiben. (full form x object)

* 8 items, 32 fillers
* Social qualities: educated (*gebildet*), arrogant (*arrogant*), articulate (*wortgewandt*), polite (*höflich*), relaxed (*locker*), pedantic (*pingelig*), formal (*formell*), friendly (*freundlich*)

### Implementation
This experiment was conducted on the online plattform [Ibex Farm](https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/ibex/). The codes of the experiment can be found [here](https://github.com/Lu-Yanru/Ibex_A04_MG_TD0).

* 23 participants
    + 17 female, 3 male, 1 diverse, 2 not specified
    + 21 aged between 18 and 25, 1 aged between 36 and 45, 1 aged between 56 and 65

### Results
* Main effect of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">topic drop</span> for the scales: educated, articulate, polite, pedantic, formal and friendly (not for arrogant and relaxed).

  topic drop rated lower than full form.

* Interaction for the scales: polite and formal

  topic drop x subject rated lower than topic drop x object.
